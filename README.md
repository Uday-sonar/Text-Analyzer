# Text Analyzer

## Description
The Text Analyzer is a Java program that performs multiple operations to analyze a given text string. It is designed to provide insights into the text by counting words, identifying the longest word, analyzing character frequencies, and reversing the text string. This tool is useful for basic text data analysis and can serve as a starting point for natural language processing (NLP) applications.
